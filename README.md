<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![](images/screen_1.jpg)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

<!-- ARCHITECTURE -->

## Architecture

The general architecture of the application is shown below.

![architecture](images/architecture.png)

Our application consists of four main modules :
- **Jetpack compose** : it constitutes the entire graphical interface of the application, in which the components constituting the interface and the navigation between them are defined.

- **ViewModels** : these take care of updating the graphical interface dynamically when the livedata change. They are also used as an abstraction layer to communicate with the music service connector. In our case, our ViewModels use (wrap) the livedata contained in the firebase repository.

- **ExoPlayer**: This module takes care of the media playback part, allowing our songs to be played, keeping playback in the background and offering a miniplayer in the notification bar. This component in turn is divided into :
  - **Music Service Connector**: this takes care of offering other components/modules of the system all those methods and variables to be able to manage the player.
  - **Music Service**: takes care of initialising and preparing everything necessary for multimedia playback.
  - **Callbacks**: takes care of performing actions based on specific events
  - **Converters**: take care of converting our templates into a format understandable by the player.
  - **Notification:** takes care of managing the notification system

- **Firebase**: is used to save our music playlists, in particular **Firebase Storage** is used to save all .mp3 files, album images and individual song images. While **Firebase Datastore**, which is a NoSQL database, contains all the metadata of the playlists/songs, such as the title, author, image and link to the .mp3 file (contained in the Storage).
